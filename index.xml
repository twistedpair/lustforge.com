Glassdoor is a great idea. Add transparency to the job market by making salaries, interview details, and internal company reviews public. This is information that employers intensely attempt to keep private, despite its dissemination being totally legal. One trick many companies use is telling you that you cannot do something that you legally can do.

I’ll ask “why does this POJO need to be mutated” and they quip that it doesn’t, but these setters and protected no-arg constructors are needed by MyBatis.</description></item><item><title>PreRelease: Open ICAO 24 Database</title><link>https://lust.dev/2014/10/04/prerelease-open-icao-24-database/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2014/10/04/prerelease-open-icao-24-database/</guid><description>I’ve long been a fan of aviation.

The key is the GWT History object. You can listen to its change event to know the user has gone to another Place. The restriction is we don’t know when the user has gone back.

I’m a runner and maintainer of RunPartner. Stats about runs are important to me. For years I used various Forerunner watches. But, Pebble would be better. I’ve written SDK’s for websites to work with the Garmin watches (github) but I couldn’t change the code on the Forerunner with any neat new ideas. As a software engineer, this is irksome.</description></item><item><title>GWT JSNI Variables – An Exhaustive List</title><link>https://lust.dev/2012/11/11/gwt-jsni-variables-an-exhaustive-list/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2012/11/11/gwt-jsni-variables-an-exhaustive-list/</guid><description>As anyone using the Google Web Toolkit JSNI knows, there are certain reserved variables, or “dollar words,” exposed by the GWT runtime. While you may be familiar with $wnd and $doc, there are more undocumented words. See the exhaustive (as of GWT 2.5.0) list below taken from source.
$wnd Reference to the root browser window GWT widgets are being rendered to. Note that when called from the iframe linker, GWT code runs in an iframe, not the root browser window, so calling window will reference the wrong window.</description></item><item><title>Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Broken (and fixed) in Eclipse</title><link>https://lust.dev/2012/10/24/ctrlaltarrow-broken-and-fixed-in-eclipse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2012/10/24/ctrlaltarrow-broken-and-fixed-in-eclipse/</guid><description>If you’re a pragmatic programmer, then you’ve learned all the shortcuts you can to make your coding day easier. I’ve been a fan of the numerous shortcuts in Eclipse such as Alt+Shift+S,R to create all class accessors/mutators. Still, my favorite has been Ctrl+Alt+⇑/⇓ and Ctrl+⇑/⇓ to instantly duplicate a line above or below the current line and to move it around. Who has time to select, copy, move, paste? Plus, you can now save your copy/paste buffer for more important things, like that LinkedIn password you keep changing each time they’re hacked.</description></item><item><title>Spring’s RememberMe and BadCredentialsException</title><link>https://lust.dev/2012/10/17/springs-rememberme-and-badcredentialsexception/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2012/10/17/springs-rememberme-and-badcredentialsexception/</guid><description>Spring is pretty swell, but the documentation is never what you need.

In a large project, this can mean your war file contains thousands of unneeded files. On environments like AppEngine, where the size of your war is limited, this introduces an upper bound on the application size.
Don’t worry, you can easily slim that war down.

However, you can add these tags yourself and get the IDE auto-validation auto-suggestion features.

However, due to the great precision of this value, comparisons are very error prone. For example:
0.000000000000000000000000000000001 != 0.0 For most cases, we want to round when the calculations are complete to the desired precision, rather than during intermediate steps.
DON&amp;rsquo;T USE round() as it sets the number of significant digits, not the number of decimals. It will lead to odd behavior if you do, as shown below.</description></item><item><title>Open ExtJs Menu on Mouseover</title><link>https://lust.dev/2011/07/06/open-extjs-menu-on-mouseover/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2011/07/06/open-extjs-menu-on-mouseover/</guid><description>Would you believe there is no way to open an ExtJs toolbar menu when you hover over the corresponding button?

I think so, but many cats have hairballs. For ExtJs, this includes missing the ability to update the title of a TabPanel tab title once it has been rendered. Sure, you can find the item and title properties for your tab post-render, but that won’t update your page. You need to crawl the DOM. I’ve created an update to do just this.
Just paste the below override in your code and you can then call the setTabTitle(tabNo,newTitle) method to update a given tab title.</description></item><item><title>Extjs Hidden Textfield Missing</title><link>https://lust.dev/2011/04/03/extjs-hidden-textfield-missing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2011/04/03/extjs-hidden-textfield-missing/</guid><description>I love ExtJS, but some days it just does not love me back.
For instance, if you have a hidden textfield, and you don&amp;rsquo;t set the width property, it won&amp;rsquo;t be added to your form. Sure, you say, why would you need the width for a hidden input?
