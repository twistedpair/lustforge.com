They take time, so you catch up on your blog reading while they run, but have to keep checking back on the terminal to see if they&amp;#8217;re done. Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be nice to know when a command is complete? Easy, just have it ring the Cygwin Terminal Bell!
For example, download a big file, untar it, and let me know when you&amp;#8217;re done:</description></item><item><title>Cygwin Visible Bell Enable</title><link>https://lust.dev/2011/10/03/cygwin-visible-bell-enable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2011/10/03/cygwin-visible-bell-enable/</guid><description>Cygwin is amazing for those of us stuck on Windows. The bell is not always so grand. I prefer a visible bell (like in Putty) rather than a &amp;#8220;ding!&amp;#8221; when I&amp;#8217;ve got my music going.
To enable the visible bell add the following to ~/.bashrc
set bell-style visible Ah, that&amp;rsquo;s much better! Thanks again Cygwin!</description></item><item><title>Console2 Arrow Keys Madness</title><link>https://lust.dev/2011/04/02/console2-arrow-key-error/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2011/04/02/console2-arrow-key-error/</guid><description>I&amp;#8217;m writing to tell you how to fix this error since it just drove me mad for 20 minutes.
If you are an avid user of Console2, which any Windows user should be, you might notice one day that your arrow keys scroll up and down, rather than select the most recent command. Why the heck would that happen? It does not happen in the Microsoft cmd window, but it will in Cygwin and Cmd under Console2.</description></item></channel></rss>
