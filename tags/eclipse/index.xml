Errors running builder &#39;JavaScript Validator&#39; on project &#39;com.your.project&#39;.1&amp;quot; Here is the trouble. Let&amp;#8217;s say you&amp;#8217;ve not marked your target/ directory as derived, so that the GWT Eclipse plugin can launch DevMode from there. Since Eclipse can see these files, it will try to validate that compile, minified JS that GWT created and sometimes die. You don&amp;#8217;t want this.</description></item><item><title>Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Arrow Broken (and fixed) in Eclipse</title><link>https://lust.dev/2012/10/24/ctrlaltarrow-broken-and-fixed-in-eclipse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2012/10/24/ctrlaltarrow-broken-and-fixed-in-eclipse/</guid><description>If you&amp;#8217;re a pragmatic programmer, then you&amp;#8217;ve learned all the shortcuts you can to make your coding day easier. I&amp;#8217;ve been a fan of the numerous shortcuts in Eclipse such as Alt+Shift+S,R to create all class accessors/mutators. Still, my favorite has been Ctrl+Alt+⇑/⇓ and Ctrl+⇑/⇓ to instantly duplicate a line above or below the current line and to move it around. Who has time to select, copy, move, paste? Plus, you can now save your copy/paste buffer for more important things, like that LinkedIn password you keep changing each time they&amp;#8217;re hacked.</description></item></channel></rss>
