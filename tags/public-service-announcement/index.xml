Hint, you won’t.
Glassdoor is a great idea. Add transparency to the job market by making salaries, interview details, and internal company reviews public. This is information that employers intensely attempt to keep private, despite its dissemination being totally legal. One trick many companies use is telling you that you cannot do something that you legally can do. For example, saying a user cannot do something in the Terms of Service, despite the courts ruling ToS unenforceable.</description></item></channel></rss>
