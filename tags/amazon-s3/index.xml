&lt;p>Just donâ€™t. If you canâ€™t reason why, please stop developing code critical to your business.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Git is great. &lt;em>Push&lt;/em> here, &lt;em>pull&lt;/em> there. It works so well that you might be fatuously convinced itâ€™s the perfect tool to deploy production code. Even worse, it might appear to work well at this task, further reinforcing your choiceÂ Â However, the Achilles Heel of any DVCS is your origin provider. Letâ€™s say that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bitbucket/status/460418803805855745">BitBucket&lt;/a> has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%40BitBucket%20down&amp;amp;src=typd">borked&lt;/a> their database for the 4th time this month or GitHub is suffering yet another DDNS attack. Then we see &lt;a href="http://jorgennilsson.com/article/there-is-always-a-drawback-bitbucket-major-outage">posts&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/alixandru/bitbucket-sync/issue/19/post-hook-deployment-stopped-working">opining&lt;/a> about failed Git based app deployments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Subdomain SSL Certificate Verification on Route 53</title><link>https://lust.dev/2014/03/16/subdomain-ssl-certificate-verification-on-route-53/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2014/03/16/subdomain-ssl-certificate-verification-on-route-53/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="sadly-a-godaddy-user">Sadly a GoDaddy User&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I use GoDaddy for a few domains and some SSL. Every time I need to set something up, it is like pulling teeth. First youâ€™ve got to get through four layers of sales pitches, cross sells, and upsells. Then you finally get to the admin UIâ€™s. Not the UI, the UIâ€™s. Each one of them appears to have been designed by team with a different design philosophy. To boot the docâ€™s appear to have been written by someone that never actual used the UI theyâ€™re prescribing the use of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LogRotate Apache Logs to Amazon S3</title><link>https://lust.dev/2012/07/15/logrotate-apache-logs-to-amazon-s3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lust.dev/2012/07/15/logrotate-apache-logs-to-amazon-s3/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../../img/logrotate.png">&lt;figcaption>
 &lt;h4>Legacy Log Rotation before gzip &amp;amp; scp&lt;/h4>
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>I recently moved my site &lt;a href="www.runpartner.com">RunPartner&lt;/a> to Amazon Web Services (AWS) from DreamHost because for just a few more peanuts a month I got a ton of enterprise grade services, and the server does not crash randomly any more. ðŸ˜Š&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Iâ€™m loving AWS, but one thing I wanted to do was consolidate all logs to S3. Letâ€™s say your site gets SlashDotted or Pinned. One of the first failure modes is that your logs swell up, and youâ€™re out of disk space. Since my EC2 instance has just 8GB, this is possible. But why not use that infinite storage pool in the sky, S3? Perfect.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
