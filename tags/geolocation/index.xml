It is not like the resellers did anything special to compile this information. The USPS publishes it for a fee, and then they charge you a fee for publicly available information.
That&amp;rsquo;s just not acceptable. So, I’ve written some scripts to gather all known zip codes (from 00000 – 99999) and placed them below in several common formats.</description></item></channel></rss>
