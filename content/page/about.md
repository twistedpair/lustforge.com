I’m Joseph Lust[^1] [^2].

I love mastery. Sometimes it’s mastery of an athletic pursuit, others times it’s understanding of history or scientific principles. Complex systems entertain me. Simple solutions inspire me. Pedagogy lets me give back to others.

Any given weekend you might find me running a half marathon, reading a [treatise on ETOPS][0], hiking a remote Norwegian fjord, or drafting a [meetup][1] presentation.

On weekdays, I play the cloud infrastructure and security lead at a [Boston startup][2].

Drop me a line if you’re a like minded soul.
