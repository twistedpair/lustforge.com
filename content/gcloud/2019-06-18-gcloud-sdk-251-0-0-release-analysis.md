summary: "This Google Cloud SDK release introduces significant breaking changes for Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine, requiring explicit region/global flags for certain Compute Engine resources and defaulting new GKE clusters to VPC-native mode. Key new features include enhanced Kubernetes integration for Cloud Run with a new `--platform` flag, Kerberos configuration options for Cloud Dataproc, and the promotion of GKE resource usage export to GA. Several bug fixes, such as for Cloud KMS and Firestore Emulator, along with API improvements like `PassAllFilter` exposure in Bigtable, were also included."

This Google Cloud SDK release introduces significant breaking changes for Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine, requiring explicit region/global flags for certain Compute Engine resources and defaulting new GKE clusters to VPC-native mode. Key new features include enhanced Kubernetes integration for Cloud Run with a new `--platform` flag, Kerberos configuration options for Cloud Dataproc, and the promotion of GKE resource usage export to GA. Several bug fixes, such as for Cloud KMS and Firestore Emulator, along with API improvements like `PassAllFilter` exposure in Bigtable, were also included.

## Breaking Changes

- Compute Engine commands under `gcloud beta compute target-http-proxies`, `gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies`, `gcloud beta compute url-maps`, and `gcloud beta compute health-checks` now require either a `--global` or `--region` flag.
- Kubernetes Engine cluster creation now defaults to VPC-native (IP Alias enabled) mode. To use the old Routes mode, the `--no-enable-ip-alias` flag must be explicitly specified.
- For `gcloud beta container binauthz attestations create`, the `Occurrence` type has migrated from `PgpSignedAttestation` to `GenericSignedAttestation`. Users signing JSON not generated by `binauthz create-signature-payload` must now provide this JSON via the `--payload-file` flag.

## New Features by Service

### Cloud Dataproc

- Added new flags `--kerberos-root-principal-password-uri`, `--kerberos-kms-key`, and `--kerberos-config-file` to `gcloud dataproc clusters create` and `gcloud dataproc workflow-templates set-managed-cluster` for enhanced Kerberos configuration.
  - Flags: `--kerberos-root-principal-password-uri`, `--kerberos-kms-key`, `--kerberos-config-file`

### Cloud Firestore Emulator

- Released Cloud Firestore emulator v1.5.0, which includes a new REST API to set security rules.

### Cloud Run

- Added the `--platform` flag and its respective `run/platform` property to all `gcloud beta run` commands. This flag is optional but will be required in a future release.
  - Flags: `--platform`
- Added support for connecting to clusters defined in a `kubeconfig` file. This is enabled by specifying `--platform kubernetes` (or `run/platform kubernetes`), with optional `--kubeconfig` and `--context` flags.
  - Flags: `--platform`, `--kubeconfig`, `--context`

### Compute Engine

- Added support for regional variants of `health-checks`, `url-maps`, `target-http-proxies`, and `target-https-proxies` under `gcloud beta compute`.
- Added `INTERNAL_MANAGED` as an option for `--load-balancing-scheme` to `gcloud beta compute forwarding-rules create` and `gcloud beta compute backend-services create`.
  - Flags: `--load-balancing-scheme`

### Kubernetes Engine

- Promoted resource usage export to GA. This feature can be enabled using the `--resource-usage-bigquery-dataset` flag with `gcloud container clusters create` or `gcloud container clusters update`.
  - Flags: `--resource-usage-bigquery-dataset`

## API Changes

### Cloud Bigtable

- Fixed Latin-1 regex filters to allow `\C` and exposed `PassAllFilter`.

### Kubernetes Engine

- The `Occurrence` type created by `gcloud beta container binauthz attestations create` has migrated from `PgpSignedAttestation` to `GenericSignedAttestation`.
