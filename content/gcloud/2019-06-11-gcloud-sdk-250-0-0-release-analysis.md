Google Cloud SDK 250.0.0 features a breaking change in `gcloud compute networks update`, which now polls for operation completion, requiring `--async` for immediate return. New functionalities include data import/export for Cloud Memorystore Redis, Cloud KMS integration for Pub/Sub topics, and a `core/disable_file_logging` property. This release also promotes various commands and flags in Compute Engine, Cloud Key Management Service, and Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring to GA or beta, enhancing feature stability and availability.

<!--more-->

## Breaking Changes

- Modified `gcloud compute networks update --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode` to poll and wait for operation to finish instead of returning immediately. Please use `--async` flag to reproduce the previous behavior of returning immediately.

## New Features by Service

### Cloud SDK

- Added `core/disable_file_logging` property to prevent the gcloud command-line tool from storing logs to a file, useful if disk space is limited.

### Cloud Functions

- Added `--clear-vpc-connector` flag to `gcloud beta functions deploy`.
  - Flags: `--clear-vpc-connector`

### Cloud Memorystore

- Added `gcloud beta redis instances import` and `gcloud beta redis instances export` to import data to or export data from a Memorystore Redis instance.
- Added `gcloud beta redis operations cancel` to cancel a Memorystore Redis import or export operation.

### Cloud Pub/Sub

- Added the optional flags `--topic-encryption-key`, `--topic-encryption-key-keyring`, `--topic-encryption-key-location`, and `--topic-encryption-key-project` to `gcloud beta pubsub topics create` to support Cloud KMS integration.
  - Flags: `--topic-encryption-key`, `--topic-encryption-key-keyring`, `--topic-encryption-key-location`, `--topic-encryption-key-project`

### Compute Engine

- Modified `gcloud compute backend-services create` and `gcloud compute backend-services update` to allow toggling logging for backend services with HTTP2 protocol.

## API Changes

### App Engine

- Updated the Python SDK to version `1.9.86`.
- Updated the Java SDK to version `1.9.75`.

### Cloud Key Management Service

- Promoted `gcloud kms asymmetric-decrypt`, `gcloud kms asymmetric-sign`, and `gcloud kms keys versions get-public-key` commands to GA.
- Promoted `--attestation-file`, `--default-algorithm`, `--purpose`, and `--protection-level` flags in the `gcloud kms keys` command group to GA.

### Cloud Run

- Promoted `--service-account` flag of `gcloud run deploy` and `gcloud run services update` to beta.

### Compute Engine

- Promoted `gcloud compute instances create --source-snapshot` flag to beta.
- Promoted `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED` value of `--load-balancing-scheme` in `gcloud compute backend-services create` and `gcloud compute forwarding-rules create` to GA.
- Promoted `--server-binding` flag of `gcloud compute sole-tenancy node-templates create` to GA.
- Promoted `--enable-logging` and `--log-filter` flags of `gcloud compute routers nats` to GA.

### Kubernetes Engine

- Promoted Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring to GA. Use `--enable-stackdriver-kubernetes` with `gcloud container clusters create` or `gcloud container clusters update` to enable this feature.
- Updated several flag names in `gcloud beta container binauthz` that assumed PGP as the only supported key type.
