## Breaking Changes

- Released Cloud Firestore emulator `v1.7.0` with experimental support for the WebChannel protocol, allowing communication with browser clients.

### Kubernetes Engine

- Added `--disable-database-encryption` flag to `gcloud beta container clusters update` to allow disabling Database Encryption.
  - Flags: `--disable-database-encryption`

## Credential & Auth Changes

- Removed support for the `multistore` format for credentials. This requires a specific upgrade path for users on older versions (`<155.0.0`) involving updating to `255.0.0`, running `gcloud auth list`, and then completing the update to avoid credential loss.
