Google Cloud SDK 246.0.0 introduces a breaking change by removing `bps-` prefixed bandwidth flag values for `gcloud compute interconnects attachments` commands.

## Breaking Changes

- Removed redundant `--bandwidth` flag values with `bps-` prefix from `gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create`, `gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated update`, `gcloud compute interconnects attachments provider create`, and `gcloud compute interconnects attachments provider update` commands. Users must now use matching values without the `bps-` prefix.
