Version 200.0.0 of the Google Cloud SDK introduces several breaking changes for Cloud DNS and Cloud Interconnect commands. It adds initial beta support for the Cloud Composer service, new flags for Cloud SQL external primary instances and replicas, and Stackdriver integration for Kubernetes Engine. Internally, the SDK underwent significant refactoring for logging, resource URI parsing, and Python 2/3 string handling compatibility.

## Breaking Changes

- Modified `gcloud beta dns dnskeys describe` command to remove the `dsRecord` field. Users should now use `--format "value(ds_record())"` to access this information.
- Moved `gcloud beta dns dnskeys` commands to `gcloud beta dns dns-keys`; the old commands are deprecated and will soon be removed.
- Deprecated `gcloud compute interconnects patch` and renamed it to `gcloud compute interconnects update`.

## New Features by Service

### Cloud Composer

- Initial (beta track) release of the `gcloud beta composer` command group, providing a managed Apache Airflow service.

### Cloud SQL

- Added support for creating external primary instances via `gcloud beta sql instances create`.
  - Flags: ``--source-ip-address``, ``--source-port``
- Added support for creating read replicas of external primary instances via `gcloud beta sql instances create`.
  - Flags: ``--master-username``, ``--master-password``, ``--prompt-for-master-password``, ``--master-dump-file-path``, ``--master-ca-certificate-path``, ``--client-certificate-path``, ``--client-key-path``

### Kubernetes Engine

- Added `--enable-stackdriver-kubernetes` flag to enable Stackdriver logging and monitoring beta experience.
  - Flags: ``--enable-stackdriver-kubernetes``

## API Changes

### Cloud DNS

- Promoted `gcloud dns dns-keys list` and `gcloud dns dns-keys describe` commands to General Availability (GA).

### Compute Engine

- Promoted support for disabling firewall rules to beta.

## Unannounced Changes

*Changes found in code but not mentioned in official release notes:* 🕵️

### Refactoring

- Refactored internal logging functions (`_PrintResourceChange`, `CreatedResource`, `DeletedResource`, `RestoredResource`, `UpdatedResource`, `ResetResource`) by renaming the `async` parameter to `is_async` for clarity and to avoid conflict with the `async` keyword in Python 3.7+.
  - File: [log.py:985](https://github.com/twistedpair/google-cloud-sdk/blob/200.0.0/google-cloud-sdk/lib/googlecloudsdk/core/log.py#L985)
- Introduced a conditional check `if collection_info.enable_uri_parsing:` around `_AddParserForUriPath`, suggesting a new mechanism to control URI parsing for resource collections.
  - File: [resources.py:821](https://github.com/twistedpair/google-cloud-sdk/blob/200.0.0/google-cloud-sdk/lib/googlecloudsdk/core/resources.py#L821)
- Updated `tokenizer.py` by adding `from __future__ import unicode_literals` and changing `io.BytesIO` to `io.StringIO` for string handling, indicating a refactoring effort towards better Python 2/3 compatibility and consistent unicode behavior.
  - File: [tokenizer.py:17](https://github.com/twistedpair/google-cloud-sdk/blob/200.0.0/google-cloud-sdk/lib/googlecloudsdk/core/util/tokenizer.py#L17)

### Groundwork

- Added `dns` to `_API_TO_TRANSFORMS` to enable resource transformations for Cloud DNS API responses, likely in support of the announced Cloud DNS command changes and GA promotion.
  - File: [resource_transform.py:1339](https://github.com/twistedpair/google-cloud-sdk/blob/200.0.0/google-cloud-sdk/lib/googlecloudsdk/core/resource/resource_transform.py#L1339)
