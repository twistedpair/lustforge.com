Google Cloud SDK 239.0.0 introduces new autoscaling policy management for Cloud Dataproc and promotes several Shielded VM features to GA in Compute Engine, including `gcloud compute instances get-shielded-identity` and various `--shielded-*` flags. This release also removes several deprecated `--shielded-vm-*` flags, marking them as breaking changes for users still relying on them, and updates `kubectl` versioning logic for Kubernetes Engine. No unannounced changes could be identified without the Git Diff.

- Removed the deprecated `--shielded-vm-vtpm`, `--shielded-vm-secure-boot`, and `--shielded-vm-integrity-monitoring` flags from `gcloud compute instance-templates create` (previously in alpha and beta).
- Removed the deprecated `--shielded-vm-vtpm`, `--shielded-vm-secure-boot`, `--shielded-vm-integrity-monitoring`, and `--shielded-vm-learn-integrity-policy` flags from `gcloud compute instances update` (previously in alpha and beta).

## New Features by Service

### Cloud Dataproc

- Added `gcloud beta dataproc autoscaling-policies` command group for managing Cloud Dataproc autoscaling policies.
- Added the `--autoscaling-policy` flag to `gcloud beta dataproc clusters create`, `gcloud beta dataproc clusters update`, and `gcloud beta dataproc workflow-templates set-managed-cluster` to support enabling and disabling autoscaling on clusters.
  - Flags: `--autoscaling-policy`

### Kubernetes Engine

- Introduced the `--no-enable-autoupgrade` flag to disable node auto-upgrade, in preparation for its default enablement in June 2019 for newly created clusters and node pools.

## API Changes

### Cloud Firestore Emulator

- Released Cloud Firestore Emulator version 1.4.1, which fixes a bug where an empty `CommitRequest` would trigger exceptions.

### Cloud Resource Manager

- Promoted the `resource-manager folders` command group to GA, indicating its stability and readiness for general use.

### Compute Engine

- Promoted the `--bandwidth` flag of `gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create` and `gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated update` to GA.
- Promoted the `load_balancing_scheme` enum value `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED` to beta for `gcloud compute forwarding-rules create` and `gcloud compute backend-services create`.
- Promoted `gcloud compute instances get-shielded-identity` to GA.
- Promoted the `--shielded-vtpm`, `--shielded-secure-boot`, and `--shielded-integrity-monitoring` flags of `gcloud compute instances create` to GA.
- Promoted the `--shielded-vtpm`, `--shielded-secure-boot`, and `--shielded-integrity-monitoring` flags of `gcloud compute instance-templates create` to GA.
- Promoted the `--shielded-vtpm`, `--shielded-secure-boot`, `--shielded-integrity-monitoring`, and `--shielded-learn-integrity-policy` flags of `gcloud compute instances update` to GA.

### Kubernetes Engine

- Updated Google Container Engine's `kubectl` to first attempt to match the API server version, delegating to the matching version if successful, and defaulting to `kubectl 1.11.7` otherwise.
- Updated extra Google Kubernetes Engine `kubectl` patch versions for 1.9 (1.9.11), 1.10 (1.10.13), 1.11 (1.11.8), 1.12 (1.12.6), and 1.13 (1.13.4).
