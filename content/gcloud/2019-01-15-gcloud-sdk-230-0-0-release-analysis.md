Version 230.0.0 introduces several breaking changes, notably fixing symlink handling for App Engine and Cloud Functions source uploads, which may affect deployments. It deprecates First Generation Cloud SQL instances and renames Compute Engine Shielded VM flags. New features include an alternative `--zone` flag for Cloud SQL instance creation and expanded Cloud Scheduler region support.

## Breaking Changes

- Fixed a bug where symlinked directories were skipped on App Engine source upload. Second Generation runtimes and source directories using `.gcloudignore` now upload contents of symlinked directories, matching First Generation runtimes. To explicitly skip a symlinked directory, add it to `.gcloudignore`.
- Fixed a bug where symlinked directories were skipped on Cloud Functions source upload. To explicitly skip a symlinked directory, add it to `.gcloudignore`.
- The flags `--region`, `--gce-zone`, and `--zone` are now mutually exclusive for the command `gcloud sql instances create`.
- Deprecated the creation of First Generation Cloud SQL instances, adding a warning and confirmation prompt to `gcloud sql instances create`.
- Deprecated First Generation Cloud SQL instances, adding warnings to `gcloud sql instances describe` and `gcloud sql instances patch`.
- Deprecated the `--auto-create-routes` flag of `gcloud alpha compute networks peerings create` in Beta.
- Deprecated and renamed the following `--shielded-vm-*` flags: `--shielded-vm-secure-boot` as `--shielded-secure-boot`, `--shielded-vm-vtpm` as `--shielded-vtpm`, `--shielded-vm-integrity-monitoring` as `--shielded-integrity-monitoring`, and `--shielded-vm-learn-integrity-policy` as `--shielded-learn-integrity-policy`.
- Deprecated the `--app-package` and `--test-package` flags in `gcloud firebase test android run` commands.
- Removed three robo test args: `--max-steps`, `--max-depth`, and `--app-initial-activity` from `gcloud firebase test android run` commands.

## Security Updates

- Fixed a bug where symlinked directories were skipped on App Engine source upload, which could have led to unintended file omissions or inclusions. This change ensures proper handling based on `.gcloudignore`. [MEDIUM]
- Fixed a bug where symlinked directories were skipped on Cloud Functions source upload, which could have led to unintended file omissions or inclusions. This change ensures proper handling based on `.gcloudignore`. [MEDIUM]
