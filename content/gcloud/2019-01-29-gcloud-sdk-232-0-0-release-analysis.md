This release includes several breaking changes, notably the deprecation of `gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autohealing` and a new hard requirement for `gcloud container clusters create` when using the CloudRun add-on. Key new features include the `--enable-display-device` flag for Compute Engine instances and `--max-pods-per-node` for GKE clusters. Additionally, several IAM policy commands for Compute Engine resources have been promoted to GA, and a problematic fix for `gcloud sql connect` was rolled back.

## Breaking Changes

- Added a warning on cluster and node-pool creation (via `gcloud container clusters create` and `gcloud container node-pools create`) to notify users that modifications on the boot disks of node VMs do not persist across node recreations and must be done using a DaemonSet.
- Deprecated the `gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autohealing` command. Users should now use `gcloud compute instance-groups managed update` instead.
- Modified the `--enable-stackdriver-kubernetes` flag to be a hard requirement for `--addons=CloudRun` when creating Kubernetes Engine clusters (via `gcloud container clusters create`).

## New Features by Service

### Compute Engine

- Added the `--enable-display-device` flag to `gcloud beta compute instances create` and `gcloud beta compute instances update`.
  - Flags: `--enable-display-device`

### Kubernetes Engine

- Added the `--max-pods-per-node` flag to `gcloud beta container clusters create`.
  - Flags: `--max-pods-per-node`

## API Changes

### Cloud SQL

- Rolled back a previous fix to `gcloud sql connect` that was causing additional connection issues, potentially affecting connection behavior.

### Compute Engine

- Promoted IAM policy commands (`get-iam-policy`, `set-iam-policy`, `add-iam-policy-bindings`, `remove-iam-policy-bindings`) to General Availability (GA) for `gcloud compute disks`, `gcloud compute images`, `gcloud compute instance-templates`, and `gcloud compute snapshots`.

### Kubernetes Engine

- Promoted the `--database-encryption-key` flag for `gcloud container clusters create` to beta, enabling support for encryption of Kubernetes Secrets.
