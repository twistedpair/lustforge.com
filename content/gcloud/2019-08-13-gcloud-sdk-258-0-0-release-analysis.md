Version 258.0.0 introduces a breaking change by renaming a Compute Engine VM flag. It enhances security by disallowing unauthenticated callers by default for new Cloud Functions in beta, and adds new lifecycle management features for Cloud Dataproc clusters and Shielded VM options for Kubernetes Engine nodes.

## Breaking Changes

- Renamed the flag `--custom-vm-gen` to `--custom-vm-type` for the following commands: `gcloud compute instances create`, `gcloud compute instances create-with-container`, `gcloud compute instances import`, `gcloud compute instances set-machine-type`, `gcloud compute instance-template create`, and `gcloud compute instance-template create-with-container`.

## Security Updates

- The `gcloud beta functions deploy` command now disallows unauthenticated callers of new functions by default, enhancing the default security posture for new deployments. [MEDIUM]

## New Features by Service

### Cloud Dataproc

- Added flags to `gcloud dataproc clusters create` for controlling cluster lifecycle management.
  - Flags: `--max-age`, `--max-idle`, `--expiration-time`
- Added flags to `gcloud dataproc clusters update` for modifying cluster lifecycle settings.
  - Flags: `--max-age`, `--max-idle`, `--expiration-time`, `--no-max-age`, `--no-max-idle`

### Kubernetes Engine

- Added flags `--shielded-secure-boot` and `--shielded-integrity-monitoring` to `gcloud beta container clusters create` to enable Shielded VM options on cluster nodes.
  - Flags: `--shielded-secure-boot`, `--shielded-integrity-monitoring`

## API Changes

### Cloud Firestore Emulator

- Released Cloud Firestore emulator v1.7.1, which fixes a bug where auth context was always null when using WebChannel and renames the experimental flag `--webchannel-port` to `--webchannel_port`.

### Cloud Storage

- Updated the `gsutil` component to version 4.42.
