We use Apache Spark for various applications at [my job](https://mc10inc.com), but Spark is still relatively unstable, as evidenced by the project's [11K+](https://github.com/apache/spark/pulls) pull requests. To maintain developer velocity, we regularly patch show stopper bugs in the Spark source. The process is simple.

1. Install JDK 6, which is required for PySpark (or you'll get a lengthy warning). Use the `oracle-java8-set-default` package to switch between Java 6 and 8, or set `JAVA_HOME`.

	```bash
	sudo apt-get install oracle-java6-installer
	oracle-java8-set-default # Go back to Java 8 when you're done building
	```

2. Fork the [Apache Spark repo](https://github.com/apache/spark) so you can submit a Pull Request later
3. Clone it locally, checking out your tag of interest

	```bash
	git clone git@github.com:mc10-inc/spark.git special-spark
	cd special-spark
	git checkout v1.4.1 # Tag of interest
	JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle" # In case you've got 7/8/9 installed
	./make-distribution.sh --name al-dente-spark --tgz
	# Build time of 5:40.12s on my i7-4790K
	```
4. Fire up your custom spark build like any other

    ```bash
    ./dist/bin/spark-shell
    ```

5. Copy the Spark assembly jar to your servers and reboot. Be sure to remove the old artifact, otherwise the ClassLodaer will load both versions and be vexed.

    ```bash
    #Move original assembly to backup location
    SPK_PATH=<your spark path>
    mv $SPK_PATH/lib/spark-assembly-1.<spark version>-hadoop2.4.0.jar spark-assembly-backup.jar
    cp dist/lib/spark-assembly-<spark version>-hadoop2.2.0.jar $SPK_PATH/lib/
    ./bin/spark-shell # Contact!
    ```

## Additional Tricks

Scala 2.10 is old hat. Most people develop on Scala 2.11, and 2.12 will be released in 2 months. To run Spark on Scala 2.11, you must build it [yourself](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html#building-for-scala-211).

```bash
./dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.11
./make-distribution.sh --name al-dente-spark --tgz # Build again
```

### Possible Failures

Possible error message below, if you don't use Java 6. I use PySpark, so I need that integration. Why Python needs a version of Java EoL'd [3 years ago](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html) is beyond me, but then again, Python 3 split from Python 2 eight years ago.
