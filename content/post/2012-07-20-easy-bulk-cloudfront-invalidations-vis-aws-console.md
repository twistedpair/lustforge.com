Google for invalidating a bunk of CloudFront files and you&#8217;ll find many utilities to help you, but did you know you can do it easily through the AWS Console?

Just visit **CloudFront > Distribution Settings > Invalidations > Create Invalidation**

Now provide the folder and wildcard to blow away a bunch of files!

```bash
i.e. images/*
```

{{< figure src="/img/cloudfront_invalidations.png" >}}

See, and you did not need to write a rate controlled script, pay a 3rd party monthly website, or enter your secret AWS credentials into some shady webapp!
