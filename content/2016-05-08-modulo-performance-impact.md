I was surprised when someone told me not to use the [modulo operator][7] in high performance code. My textbooks used modulo (`%`) and various high performance implementations [say to use modulo][10]. Where had I gone wrong?

## The Bad
If you look at the JDK's `mod()` implementation, you'll see that it's indeed `O(n)` [for IEE754 floats][12], and `O(1)` [for doubles][13]. Note, the Java Spec defines modulo for integers and also [for negative floating point numbers][5].

Luckily, there are tricks for modulo with integers.

## High Performance Modulo

Here's the trick; __don't use floats__. Floats are a pain for numerous reason, but let's assume you're wise enough to use a primitive integer type (int or long) to feed you `mod()` code, such as your hashmap implementation. There are many neat [bit twiddling tricks][6] to quickly conjure `mod(int,int)`.

### Powers of Two

Computers are binary by nature, so using powers of two provide lots of tricks. These can compute `mod(int, somePowerOf2)` in only a _single machine instruction_! Here's how.


<!-- %[link to LustBox algos][1] -->

For example, if I want to do `61 % 8`, to know which of an `Array[Byte]` to grab a value from, we can think of it in binary as [logical conjunction][14] of the dividend with the  mask of all bits lower than the divisor. For powers of 2, that's just n-1. The bit operations are illustrated below, using 32 bit integers.

[{{< figure src="/img/bit_diagram.svg" caption="Note: Applicable only to Natural Integers" >}}](/img/bit_diagram.svg)

We can code this simply as:

```scala 
def modPow2(n:Int, p2: Int) = n & (p2-1)

def isPow2(n:Int):Boolean = ((n-1) & n ) == 0

def modFast(n:Int, b: Int) = if (isPow2(b)) modPow2(n,b) else n % b

// The old way
def modOld(n:Int, b:Int) = n % b
```

## Performance Comparsion

Comparing the byte code of classic modulo, and our faster version, we see they are both **4 lines of byte code**. However, classic `%` calls the byte code operation [`irem`][15] which itself calls a native routine, so it's far more complicated and won't run in constant time.

```java
  public int modOld(int, int);
    Code:
       0: iload_1
       1: iload_2
       2: irem
       3: ireturn

  public int modPow2(int, int); // with 8-1 inlined
    Code:
       0: iload_1
       1: bipush        7
       3: iand
       4: ireturn
```

A simple benchmark[^1] on bare metal[^2] shows what we expect, doing one billion passes of each.

- Power 8 trick is the fastest
- `irem` implementation is nearly as fast
- `fmod` implementation is 3x slower

## Conclusions

- Modulo isn't a major performance hog
- Avoid Double modulo operations if possible (can you use int's?)
- The reference Java modulo implementation is fast
- For `mod(a,2^n)` operations, `modPow2` is ~23% faster than stock moduolo

If modulo is a critical path in your code, and your divisor is a power of 2 (with Natural dividends), use this trick. Otherwise, the stock JVM implementation should serve you well.
