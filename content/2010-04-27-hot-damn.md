I'm Joseph Lust. 

I do many interesting and curious things. I've resisted the "weblog" or so called "blog" movement for some time, mainly due to aversion to the bastardization of the English language that is the word "[blog][1]". However, the bastards [have won][2], and it's high time I got my thoughts online, as they might benefit others.

Unlike most WordPress blogs that run the default theme and never see more than one post, this one will.

Still, finals need to finish and I need to pick up my masters, so check back in mid May.

Cheers, <br>Joe
