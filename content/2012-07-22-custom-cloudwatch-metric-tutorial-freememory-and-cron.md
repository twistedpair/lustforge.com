### Disclaimer: Custom metrics are $0.50 USD a month. Use judiciously.

I want to be able to set alarms when nodes are getting memory starved and to analyze memory trends. Doing this for disk space, heap space, etc is a simple modification of the below tutorial.

Since the AWS docs have no complete example on how to do this, I wanted to provide one. I set this up using nothing but bash and cron (<a href="http://blogs.clogeny.com/custom-metrics-in-amazon-cloudwatch/" target="_blank">other examples</a> use Python). My goal was a very simple example.

### 1. Create a new Metric

We&#8217;ll skip this since by virtue of putting data into your new metric, CloudWatch will create it for you.

### 2. Get the free memory

Folks will tell you of `vmstat`, `free`, and other utilities, but if you read their _man_ files, you&#8217;ll see the value comes from `/proc/meminfo`, so go to the source. Let&#8217;s grep it out of there:

```bash
FREE_MEM_KB=$(egrep -o "MemFree:\s*([0-9]*)" /proc/meminfo | egrep -o "[0-9]*")
echo $FREE_MEM_KB
```

The gist is that we cannot access capture groups directly in _egrep_, but we can hit it twice with a pipe for the same effect. The `-o` is used to only return the matching fragment.

### 3. Pick a Good Name

I found the terms used in the CloudWatch docs a little confusing at first, so here it how to find them. Check on any of your metrics in the AWS CloudWatch Console as shown below:

**Namespace**

There are existing namespaces like _AWS/EC2_ and _AWS/RDS_. Don&#8217;t set metrics here, these are for AWS only. Make up a new namespace for your metric like &#8220;MySite.&#8221;

**MetricName**

A short descriptive name, preferentially CamelCase. Remember, you cannot delete or change it! Think hard. Note the metric will be expelled after two weeks of disuse.

**Dimensions**

Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got a _FreeMemory_ metric in your MySite namespace. What if you want to add this to another instance? You need yet another degree of freedom, _Dimensions_. In this example the _InstandId_ is the dimension being used, but you can set others if you like.

### 4. Send it to CloudWatch

Make sure you&#8217;ve installed the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/2534" target="_blank">CloudFront Commandline Tools</a>. The README.txt explains it all quite well.

Now just fire away:

```bash
FREEMEMKB=$(egrep -o "MemFree:\s*([0-9]*)" /proc/meminfo | egrep -o "[0-9]*")
echo `mon-put-data --namespace="MySite" --metric-name=FreeMemory --dimensions="InstanceId=i-d889e31d" --unit=Kilobytes --value=$FREEMEMKB`
```

As you can see, we just specify the three degrees of freedom, the units, and the value. Done! And look, we just ran it twice and we&#8217;ve already got a chart. Amazon says it can take 15min to see your new metric and 2min to see a new data value. I found these to all happen within a minute, but depends on the ambient CloudWatch load.

### Script It

If found the my variables were not always available to my cron user, so I put them in the bash file (below).

```bash
#setup variables
export AWS_CLOUDWATCH_HOME=/home/myuser/cloudwatch/CloudWatch-1.0.12.1
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre1.6.0_33
export AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE=$AWS_CLOUDWATCH_HOME/credential-file-path.template

# get free memory and send to AWS CloudWatch
FREEMEMKB=$(egrep -Eio "MemFree:\s*([0-9]*)" /proc/meminfo | egrep -Eio "[0-9]*")
echo `/home/myuser/cloudwatch/CloudWatch-1.0.12.1/mon-put-data --namespace="MySite" --metric-name=FreeMemory --dimensions="InstanceId=i-d889e31d" --unit=Kilobytes --value=$FREEMEMKB`
```

And just added the line to the cron file. Note the full paths given since cron does not know these.

```bash
# Update AWS custom metric monitors every minute
*/1     *       *       *       *       /home/myuser/scripts/cloudfront_update_metrics.sh
```

Now enjoy the pretty charts! And set your alarms as needed at a given low memory threshold.
